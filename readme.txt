The applications print the behavior of three functions:
   · k*exp(-t*x)
   · k*sin(t*x)
   · k*cos(t*x)

You select one of the function by the ratio button.
You can variate the value of K by introducting values in to the input value
you can variate the value of T by adjusting the slide bar.

It easy to use!! enjoy!
